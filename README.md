Diabetes- understanding the problem
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that is associated with elevated blood sugar levels in the body. Diabetes often leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney damage, and long-term damage to the extremities (that is, limbs and eyes). It is estimated that there are 415 million people in the world suffering from diabetes, with up to 5 million deaths every year attributed to diabetes-related complications. In the United States, diabetes is estimated to be the seventh highest cause of death. Clearly, diabetes is a
cause of concern to the wellbeing of modern society. Diabetes can be divided into two subtypes: type 1 and type 2. 

Type 1 diabetes results from the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin. Type 1 diabetes is relatively rare compared to type 2 diabetes, and it only accounts for approximately 5% of diabetes. Unfortunately, the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown and therefore, it is difficult to prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes results from the body's gradual resistance to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the
prevalent form of diabetes in the world, and it is caused by excessive body weight, irregular exercise, and a poor diet. Fortunately, the onset of type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed if diagnosed early. One of the barriers for early detection and diagnosis of diabetes is that the early stages of diabetes are often non-symptomatic People who are on the path to diabetes (also known as  prediabetes) often do not know that they have diabetes until it is too late.

# The diabetes mellitus dataset
The dataset that I used for this project comes from the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, as provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (and hosted by Kaggle).
